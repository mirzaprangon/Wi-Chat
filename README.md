Networking and telecommunication is the main source of information and communication for mankind now a day. We make business proposal while being abroad, we can communicate with a man who is continents away with a click of a button. Or talk with our near and dear ones from anywhere. Life has become indeed easier. We are living in a vast ocean of digital signals, trillions of trillions of bits floating around us, searching their destination.

This project is a simple project in the field of networking and telecommunication. With this application two users can communicate with each other by text message through LAN.

The goal of this project was not to build a robust application for communication. It is a simple text chat client which works on Local Area Network. But the goal of this project was to familiarize us, the students with the way networking works, infrastructure of the network itself, how to write an application to communicate through network, how to implement network programming procedure to achieve a working solution. Thus this is our small journey to finish a project, stumble two or three times in the way while learning many things in the process. We ought to tell, it was fun to do.
